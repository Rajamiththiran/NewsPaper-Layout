            Elon Musk seems pretty proud of his company SpaceX's new rocket
            engines.

            This week, Musk showed off a batch of<br />
            the new Raptor 2 engines at the SpaceX's<br />
            Starbase facility in Texas, where they will be used<br />
            on the first orbital flight of the company's<br />
            Starship megarocket later this year.<br /><br />
            "Raptor 2 rocket engines at Starbase,<br />
            each producing over half a million pounds (230 tons) of<br />
            force," Musk wrote(opens in new tab) in the Twitter post on Tuesday
            (April 26).<br />
            Musk's photo showed what appeared<br />
            to be over a dozen of the new rocket engines,<br />
            but his Twitter fans saw something else:<br />
            evil Daleks from Doctor Who.
          </p>

        <div class="item-24">

            "It was only a matter of time before he<br />
            started building Daleks," wrote Twitter user<br />
            Richard Nellisas the term "Daleks" began<br />
            trending after Musk's photo post.<br />
            <br />
            "Turns out Elon has created Daleks.<br />
            Elon IS Davros," wrote Simon, another Twitter user<br />
            , referring to the creator of the Dalek warriors,<br />
            who reside inside machines do bear some<br />
            resemblance to a rocket engine nozzle.<br /><br />
            To be clear, Elon Musk has not created a race<br />
            of evil warriors that cry "Exterminate!" as<br />
            they take over the world.
